# Magenda Store custom scripts and widgets

Code to customize magenda-party.myshopify.com e-commerce
site.

A collection of html and css styles using liquid as the
templating language. As a first iteration, the widgets
will be mostly standalone scripts and markups that I'm planning to eventually turn into layouts.

This collection is supposed to extend the Dawn theme and
the plan is to avoid JavaScript as much as possible since
this is the way Dawn is coded.

I will be updating this README as I go, with various
troubleshoots that I encounter and possible
solutions, along with whatever tips and wisdom I 
gather on the way.
